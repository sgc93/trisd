## Introduction
Last I cheaked Many large corporations already use 3D graphics to showcase their products.```showcasing products``` and ```place visualization & prosentation``` are real world subjects that initiate me to learn 3D website development and do this project.

TRISD has a single major functionality:
- It allows users to display their 3d models (.glb/.gltf file) <br />
        > actually its customizability gives it an intersting feature that enables users to change contents of the page (like changing the logo, updating all hero section text contents, change every components postion, resize texts and the logo, ... ) and have their own ui design ... take it a sreenshoot ... use it for something ... or just play around till you get something ...

## Live Demo 

   https://trisd.netlify.app/   < it will take a little long time to load all data like textures and 3d model ... give it some time ðŸ˜Š.
